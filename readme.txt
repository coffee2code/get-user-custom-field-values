Use a widget, shortcode, and/or template tags to easily retrieve and display custom field values for the currently logged in (or any specific) user.


== Description ==

This plugin provides a powerful widget, shortcode (with shortcode builder tool), and template tags for easily retrieving and displaying custom field values for the currently logged in user or any specified user.

This plugin provides functionality similar to the [Get Custom Field Values](http://coffee2code.com/wp-plugins/get-custom-field-values/) plugin, but for user custom fields (which WordPress manages in a separate database table).

This plugin does NOT help you in setting user custom field values, nor does it provide an interface to list or otherwise manage user custom fields.

The list of useful user custom field values that are provided by default in WordPress are:

* first_name
* last_name
* nickname
* description
* aim
* yim
* jabber

It is up to other plugins or custom code to add additional user custom fields that you may then be able to retrieve with this plugin.

2. A screenshot of the 'Get User Custom' shortcode builder.


== Installation ==

1. Unzip `get-user-custom-field-values.zip` inside the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (or install via the built-in WordPress plugin installer)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress
1. (Optional) Add filters for 'the_user_meta' to filter user custom field data (see the end of the file for commented out samples you may wish to include).  And/or add per-meta filters by hooking 'the_user_meta_$field'
1. Give a user a custom field with a value, or have user custom fields already defined.  (This generally entails use of plugin(s) that utilize the user custom fields feature built into WordPress. By default, in a practical sense WordPress only sets the 'first_name', 'last_name', and 'nickname' user custom fields, so you could try using one of them, even if just for testing even though WordPress provides functions to get those particular fields.)
1. Use the provided 'Get User Custom' widget  -or-
Use the available shortcode in a post or page  -or-
Use the function `c2c_get_current_user_custom()` if you wish to access user custom fields for the currently logged
in user.  Use the function `c2c_get_user_custom()` to access user custom fields for a specified user.  User the function
`c2c_get_author_custom()` to access custom fields for the current author (when on the permalink page for a post, page, or
in a loop).  Prepend either of the three mentioned functions with 'echo' to display the contents of the custom field; or
use the return value as an argument to another function.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I assign users custom fields so that I can retrieve them using this plugin? =

The user profile page within WordPress provides inputs for a handful of user custom fields (first_name, last_name, aim, yim, jabber, description, etc).  However, you're probably more interested in creating your own user custom fields.  In that case, you'll have to use another plugin to store custom fields for users, or directly use WordPress functions manually.

= I don't plan on using the shortcode builder when writing or editing a post or page, so how do I get rid of it? =

When on the Write or Edit admin pages for a page or post, find the "Screen Options" link near the upper right-hand corner.  Clicking it slides down a panel of options.  In the "Show on screen" section, uncheck the checkbox labeled "Get User Custom Field Values - Shortcode".  This must be done separately for posts and for pages if you want the shortcode builder disabled for both sections.

= Does this plugin include unit tests? =

Yes.


== Template Tags ==

The plugin provides three optional template tags for use in your theme templates.

= Functions =

* `<?php function c2c_get_current_user_custom( $field, $before='', $after='', $none='', $between='', $before_last='' ) ?>`
This allows access to custom fields for the currently logged in user.  If the current visitor is NOT logged in, then the `$none` value is returned.

* `<?php function c2c_get_author_custom( $field, $before='', $after='', $none='', $between='', $before_last='' ) ?>`
This allows access to custom fields for the current author (when on the permalink page for a post, page, or in a loop).

* `<?php function c2c_get_user_custom( $user_id, $field, $before='', $after='', $none='', $between='', $before_last='' ) ?>`
This allows access to custom fields for any user specified by the `$user_id` value.

= Arguments =

* `$user_id`
(only for `c2c_get_user_custom()`) The integer value of the user's id.

* `$field`
The name of the user custom field to display.

* `$before`
(optional) The text to display before all field value(s).

* `$after`
(optional) The text to display after all field value(s).

* `$none`
(optional) The text to display in place of the field value should no field value exists; if defined as '' and no field value exists, then nothing (including no `$before` and `$after`) gets displayed.

* `$between`
(optional) The text to display between multiple occurrences of the custom field; if defined as '', then only the first instance will be used.

* `$before_last`
optional) The text to display between the next-to-last and last items listed when multiple occurrences of the custom field exist; `$between` MUST be set to something other than '' for this to take effect.

= Examples =

* `<?php c2c_get_current_user_custom('first_name'); ?>`
"Scott"

* `<?php c2c_get_current_user_custom('favorite_colors', 'Favorite colors: '); /* Where the 'favorite_colors' user custom field has been defined with values ?>`
"Favorite colors: blue, gray, green, black, red"

* `<?php c2c_get_current_user_custom('favorite_colors', 'Favorite colors: <ul><li>', '</li></ul>', '', '</li><li>'); ?>`
"Favorite colors: <ul><li>blue</li><li>gray</li><li>green</li><li>black</li><li>red</li></ul>"

* `<?php echo c2c_get_user_custom(3, 'first_name', 'Hi, ', '.  Welcome back.'); // where 3 is the id of the user we want ?>`
"Hi, Scott.  Welcome back."


== Filters ==

The plugin exposes five filters for hooking.  Typically, customizations utilizing these hooks would be put into your active theme's functions.php file, or used by another plugin.

= c2c_get_current_user_custom (filter) =

The 'c2c_get_current_user_custom' hook allows you to use an alternative approach to safely invoke `c2c_get_current_user_custom()` in such a way that if the plugin were deactivated or deleted, then your calls to the function won't cause errors in your site.

Arguments:

* same as for `c2c_get_current_user_custom()`

Example:

Instead of:

`<?php $twitter = c2c_get_current_user_custom( 'twitter' ); ?>`

Do:

`<?php $twitter = apply_filters( 'c2c_get_current_user_custom', 'twitter' ); ?>`

= c2c_get_author_custom (filter) =

The 'c2c_get_author_custom' hook allows you to use an alternative approach to safely invoke `c2c_get_author_custom()` in such a way that if the plugin were deactivated or deleted, then your calls to the function won't cause errors in your site.

Arguments:

* same as for `c2c_get_author_custom()`

Example:

Instead of:

`<?php $aim = c2c_get_author_custom( 'aim', 'AIM: ' ); ?>`

Do:

`<?php $aim = apply_filters( 'c2c_get_author_custom', 'aim', 'AIM: ' ); ?>`

= c2c_get_user_custom (filter) =

The 'c2c_get_user_custom' hook allows you to use an alternative approach to safely invoke `c2c_get_user_custom()` in such a way that if the plugin were deactivated or deleted, then your calls to the function won't cause errors in your site.

Arguments:

* same as for `c2c_get_user_custom()`

Example:

Instead of:

`<?php $address = c2c_get_user_custom( 5, 'address' ); ?>`

Do:

`<?php $address = apply_filters( 'c2c_get_user_custom', 5, 'address ); ?>`

= c2c_get_user_custom_field_values_shortcode (filter) =

The 'c2c_get_user_custom_field_values_shortcode' hook allows you to define an alternative to the default shortcode tag.  By default the shortcode tag name used is 'user_custom_field'.  It is recommended you only utilize this filter before making use of the plugin's shortcode in posts and pages.  If you change the shortcode tag name, then any existing shortcodes using an older name will no longer work (unless you employ further coding efforts).

Arguments:

* $shortcode (string)

Example:

`
// Use a shorter shortcode: i.e. [ucf field="last_name" /]
add_filter( 'c2c_get_user_custom_field_values_shortcode', 'change_c2c_get_user_custom_field_values_shortcode' );
function change_c2c_get_user_custom_field_values_shortcode( $shortcode ) {
	return 'ucf';
}
`

= c2c_get_user_custom-user_field_proxy (filter) =

The 'c2c_get_user_custom-user_field_proxy' hook allows you to prevent proxying to user object fields if no custom value for the custom field was found for the user. By default, if a user does not have a value for the given custom field, the plugin will compare the field name to the small list of user object fields (i.e. user table fields) to see if it is a valid user field. If so, then the user field value (as opposed to custom field value) is returned.

Arguments:

* $allow_proxy (boolean) Default of true.

Example:

`
// Prevent user field proxying: i.e. this would not return anything: [user_custom_field field="user_email" user_id="1" /]
add_filter( 'c2c_get_user_custom-user_field_proxy', '__return_false' );
`


== Shortcode ==

This plugin provides one shortcode that can be used within the body of a post or page.  The shortcode is accompanied by a shortcode builder (see Screenshots) that presents a form for easily creating a shortcode.  However, here's the documentation for the shortcode and its supported attributes.

= user_custom_field =

The only shortcode provided by this plugin is named `user_custom_field`.  It is a self-closing tag, meaning that it is not meant to encapsulate text.  Except for 'field', all attributes are optional, though you'll likely need to provide a couple to achieve your desired result.

The name of the shortcode can be changed via the filter 'c2c_get_user_custom_field_values_shortcode' (though making this customization is only recommended for before your first use of the shortcode, since changing to a new name will cause the shortcodes previously defined using the older name to no longer work).

Attributes:

* field       : (string) The name of the user custom field key whose value you wish to have displayed.
* id          : (string) The text to use as the 'id' attribute for a 'span' tag that wraps the output
* class       : (string) The text to use as the 'class' attribute for a 'span' tag that wraps the output
* this_post   : (boolean) Get the custom field value for the author of the post containing this shortcode? Takes precedence over user_id attribute. Specify `1` (for true) or `0` for false. Default is `0`.
* user_id     : (integer) ID of user whose custom field's value you want to display. Leave blank to search for the custom field for the currently logged in user. Use `0` to indicate it should only work on the permalink page for a page/post.
* before      : (string) Text to display before the custom field.
* after       : (string) Text to display after the custom field.
* none        : (string) Text to display if no matching custom field is found (or it has no value). Leave this blank if you don't want anything to display when no match is found.
* between     : (string) Text to display between custom field items if more than one are being shown. Default is ', '.
* before_last : (string) Text to display between the second to last and last custom field items if more than one are being shown.

Examples:

* Get nickname for current post's author
`[user_custom_field field="nickname" this_post="1" /]`

* Get AIM account name for a specific user
`[user_custom_field field="aim" user_id="2" /]`

* Wrap post author's bio in markup, but only if the author has a bio.
`[user_custom_field field="description" before="My bio:" /]`
